# SLEEPNET
### This codebase contains the code for SLEEPNET paper submitted to KDD 2017 and  links to public datasets of EEG recording with sleep stage annotations.

* Public data set of sleep stages
https://www.physionet.org/physiobank/database/capslpdb/

* extract_features.py: code to extract different expert defined features which are used the RNN model to annotate sleep stages

* rnn_data_prepare.py: code to run extract_features.py and prepare date to be used by the RNN code

* SLEEPNET.py : code to RNN model and evaluate performance





* More detailed instructions to evaluate SLEEPNET will be added soon
